## Introduction

### What are Slash Commands?

Slash commands are powerful shortcuts that trigger specialized AI agents and workflows in ClaudeKit Engineer. They follow the simple syntax:

```bash
/<command-name> [arguments]
```

Commands are stored in `.claude/commands/` directory and can be customized for your project needs.

### Benefits

- **Instant Agent Orchestration**: Trigger specialized agents with a single command
- **Consistent Workflows**: Standardized processes across your team
- **Time Savings**: Automate complex multi-step operations
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain project context across agent handoffs

### How Commands Work

1. Commands are Markdown files with frontmatter metadata
2. Arguments are passed using `$ARGUMENTS` (all args) or `$1`, `$2` (specific positions)
3. Each command orchestrates specialized agents to complete specific tasks
4. Results are reported back to you with summaries and recommendations

## Core Development Commands

### `/ask`

**Description**: Answer technical and architectural questions with expert consultation.

**Usage**:
```bash
/ask [technical-question]
```

**What it does**:
- Orchestrates four specialized architectural advisors:
  - Systems Designer (system boundaries & component interactions)
  - Technology Strategist (tech stacks & patterns)
  - Scalability Consultant (performance & growth)
  - Risk Analyst (issues & trade-offs)
- Provides comprehensive architectural guidance
- Offers strategic recommendations with alternatives

**Examples**:
```bash
/ask "Should we use Redis or Memcached for our caching layer?"

- Use `/brainstorm` for exploratory discussion
- Use `/ask` for architectural consultation

**For Implementation**:
- Use `/cook` for general features
- Use `/bootstrap` for new projects
- Use `/design:*` for UI/UX work
- Use `/integrate:*` for third-party services

**For Fixing Issues**:
- Use `/fix:fast` for simple bugs
- Use `/fix:hard` for complex issues

- Use `/docs:update` for comprehensive updates
- Use `/docs:summarize` for quick summary updates

### Command Chaining

Commands work best in sequences:

```bash
# Feature Development Flow
/plan "add user profiles"
# Review plan, then:
/cook "implement user profiles as planned"
/fix:test
/docs:update
/git:cp

# Bug Fix Flow
/debug "slow API responses"
# Analyze issue, then:
/fix:hard "optimize API response times"
/test
/git:cm

# Design Flow
/design:screenshot "./mockup.png"
# Review implementation, then:
/fix:layout "adjust spacing to match mockup exactly"
/git:cp
```

### Tips for Success

1. **Be Specific**: Provide clear, detailed descriptions in arguments
2. **Use Visuals**: Include screenshots/videos for design and layout issues
3. **Review Plans**: Always review plans before implementation
4. **Test Early**: Use `/test` frequently during development
5. **Update Docs**: Use `/docs:update` after significant changes
6. **Clean Commits**: Use `/git:cm` or `/git:cp` for professional git history

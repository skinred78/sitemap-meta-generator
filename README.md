# Claude Code Boilerplate

A comprehensive boilerplate template for building professional software projects with **CLI Coding Agents** (**Claude Code** and **Open Code**). This template provides a complete development environment with AI-powered agent orchestration, automated workflows, and intelligent project management.

## What is Claude Code?

**Claude Code** is Anthropic's official CLI tool that brings AI-powered development assistance directly to your terminal. It enables natural language interaction with your codebase and provides intelligent automation for common development tasks.

## Release Information

This project uses automated releases with semantic versioning:

- **Automatic Releases**: Every push to `main` branch triggers a new release if there are releasable changes
- **Semantic Versioning**: Version numbers follow [SemVer](https://semver.org/) (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- **Conventional Commits**: Use [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/) format for automatic changelog generation
- **GitHub Releases**: Releases are automatically created on GitHub with generated changelogs
- **NPM Publishing**: Packages are automatically published to NPM registry

### Commit Message Format

```bash
# Features (minor version bump)
feat: add new authentication system

# Bug fixes (patch version bump)
fix: resolve memory leak in user service

# Breaking changes (major version bump)
feat!: redesign API endpoints
# or
feat: redesign API endpoints

BREAKING CHANGE: API endpoints have been redesigned

# Other types (patch version bump)
docs: update installation guide
refactor: simplify database queries
test: add integration tests
ci: update GitHub Actions workflow
```

### Setup
1. **Use this template**:
   ```bash
   # Create new project from this template
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/claude-code-template.git my-project
   cd my-project
   ```

2. **Configure for your repository**:
   ```bash

   - The `GITHUB_TOKEN` is automatically provided by GitHub Actions

3. **Start development**:
   ```bash
   # Begin with Claude Code
   claude

   # Or use specific commands
   /plan "implement user authentication"
   /cook "add database integration"

## The AI Agent Team

This boilerplate includes specialized AI agents that work together to deliver high-quality software:

### 🎯 Core Development Agents

#### **Planner Agent**
- Researches technical approaches and best practices
- Creates comprehensive implementation plans
- Analyzes architectural trade-offs
- Spawns multiple researcher agents for parallel investigation

#### **Researcher Agent**
- Investigates specific technologies and frameworks
- Analyzes existing solutions and patterns
- Provides technical recommendations
- Supports the planner with detailed findings

#### **Tester Agent**
- Generates comprehensive test suites
- Validates functionality and performance
- Ensures cross-platform compatibility
- Reports on test coverage and quality metrics

### 🔍 Quality Assurance Agents

#### **Code Reviewer Agent**
- Performs automated code quality analysis
- Enforces coding standards and conventions
- Identifies security vulnerabilities
- Provides improvement recommendations

#### **Debugger Agent**
- Analyzes application logs and error reports
- Diagnoses performance bottlenecks
- Investigates CI/CD pipeline issues
- Provides root cause analysis

### 📚 Documentation & Management Agents

#### **Docs Manager Agent**
- Maintains synchronized technical documentation
- Updates API documentation automatically
- Ensures documentation accuracy
- Manages codebase summaries

#### **Git Manager Agent**
- Creates clean, conventional commit messages
- Manages branching and merge strategies
- Handles version control workflows
- Ensures professional git history

#### **Project Manager Agent**
- Tracks development progress and milestones
- Updates project roadmaps and timelines

## Agent Orchestration Patterns

### Sequential Chaining
Use when tasks have dependencies:
```bash
# Planning → Implementation → Testing → Review
/plan "implement user dashboard"
# Wait for plan completion, then:
/cook "follow the implementation plan"
# After implementation:
/test "validate dashboard functionality"
# Finally:
/review "ensure code quality standards"
```

### Parallel Execution
Use for independent tasks:
```bash
# Multiple researchers exploring different approaches
planner agent spawns:
- researcher (database options)
- researcher (authentication methods)
- researcher (UI frameworks)
# All report back to planner simultaneously
```

### Context Management
- Agents communicate through file system reports
- Context is preserved between agent handoffs
- Fresh context prevents conversation degradation
- Essential information is documented in markdown

## Development Workflow

### 1. Feature Development
```bash
# Start with planning
/plan "add real-time notifications"

# Research phase (automatic)
# Multiple researcher agents investigate approaches

# Implementation
/cook "implement notification system"

# Quality assurance
/test
/review

# Documentation update
/docs

# Project tracking
/watzup  # Check project status
```

### 2. Bug Fixing
```bash
# Analyze the issue
/debug "investigate login failures"

# Create fix plan
/plan "resolve authentication bug"

# Implement solution
/fix "authentication issue"

# Validate fix
/test
```

### 3. Documentation Management
```bash
# Update documentation
/docs

# Generate codebase summary
repomix  # Creates ./docs/codebase-summary.md

# Review project status
/watzup
```

## Configuration Files

### CLAUDE.md
Project-specific instructions for Claude Code. Customize this file to define:

export GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY="..."
claude mcp add-json human -s user '{"command": "npx", "args": ["@goonnguyen/human-mcp@latest", "-e", "GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY"], "env": { "GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY": $GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY }}'
```
